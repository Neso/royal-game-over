# Royal Game of War - Rules

## Objective
Be the first player to move all 7 of your pieces off the board.

## Setup
- Each player starts with 7 pieces off the board.
- The board has an Entry Area, a Shared Line (Community/War Area), and a Final Safe Area.

## Dice Mechanics
- Players roll four tetrahedral (d4) dice.
- A die showing 3 or 4 counts as a success.
- The total number of successful dice determines the number of spaces a player can move.

## Movement Rules
- Players choose any single piece to move.
- Landing on an opponent's piece removes it back to their starting hand, unless the position is a 'fort spot'.
- Fort spots in the Community Area protect pieces from being removed.

## Special Spots (Rosetta Spaces)
- The 4th spot of the Entry Area: Repeat dice roll.
- The 4th spot of the Community Area: Repeat dice roll.
- The spot just before exit: Repeat dice roll.

## Winning Condition
- The first player to move all 7 pieces off the board wins instantly.

Good luck, commander!
